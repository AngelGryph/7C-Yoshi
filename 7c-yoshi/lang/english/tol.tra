@1    = ~Yoshimo, the sellsword, Bounty Hunter and sometime spy, turned to you out of honour and respect, when he would have killed you. Is he ready to fight and probably die in the upcoming battle?~
@2    = ~This isn't your fight, Yoshimo. It's mine. He forced you. There is no need for you to die here.~
@3    = ~Yoshimo, you don't have to fight Irenicus if you don't want to. He is a powerful foe, as we both know. It is still honorable to admit defeat here.~
@4    = ~He had you as his lackey, slave to his magics. This is your honour and glory, we must fight him now!~
@5    = ~No <CHARNAME>, I'm staying. I shall be careful, warier than I am normally. I am glad you aren't forcing me, so I follow you.~
@6    = ~I feel that I owe you a debt of honor, <CHARNAME>. Many would argue that you could rightly have struck me down where I stood when you I shared that Irenicus had forced me to spy on you... But I want you to know that I feel changed inside by my ordeal to get the Geas removed. Perhaps everything happens for a reason, eh? In all events, I am honored that you still allow me to accompany you on this journey. By Ilmater I swear that I will stand at your side until Irenicus is dead, <CHARNAME>.~
@7    = ~I will stand by your side! Forwards!~
